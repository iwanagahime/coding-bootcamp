<p>Inquisitive, energetic and fascinated with the diversity of cultures around the world I was quite early drawn towards learning foreign languages. At the age of six I started learning English as I desperately wanted to understand what the characters in my favorite US cartoons were actually saying. That curiosity never left me since and led me to complete my BA and MA in Teaching English as a Foreign Language back in Poland and then move to UK where I graduated with MRes in English Literature and Creative Writing. After graduating I found employment in one of Birmingham's primary schools where I not only work as a class teacher but also manage EAL students across the school and act as a MFL lead.</p>
<p>In my spare time (which is almost nonexistent) I enjoy travelling, photography, gardening and good literature and film. </p>
